# üßæ Git Cheat Sheet (One-Page)

## üîß Setup
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

---

## üìÅ Start a Repo
```bash
git init                          # Initialize new repo
git clone <repo-url>             # Clone remote repo
```

---

## üåø Branching
```bash
git branch                       # List branches
git branch <name>                # Create new branch
git checkout <name>              # Switch to branch
git checkout -b <name>           # Create and switch to new branch
git switch -c <name>             # Modern way to create & switch
git branch -m <new-name>         # Rename current branch
git branch -M <new-name>         # Force rename branch
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Making Changes
```bash
git status                       # See current changes
git add .                        # Stage all changes

git diff --staged                # Show staged changes
```

---

## üîÑ Syncing with Remote
```bash
git remote -v                    # View remotes
git push -u origin <branch>      # Push new branch and track it

git pull                         # Pull & merge latest changes
git pull --rebase                # Pull with rebase (linear history)
git fetch                        # Download remote changes (no merge)
```

---

## üóëÔ∏è Undoing Changes
```bash
git restore <file>               # Discard unstaged changes (Git 2.23+)
git checkout -- <file>           # Discard unstaged changes (older)
git reset HEAD <file>            # Unstage a staged file
git reset --soft HEAD~1          # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1          # Undo last commit (discard changes)
```

---

## üßº Clean Up
```bash
git stash                        # Save uncommitted changes
git stash pop                    # Reapply last stashed changes
git branch -d <name>             # Delete local branch (merged)
git branch -D <name>             # Force delete local branch
git push origin --delete <name>  # Delete remote branch
```

---

## üîç Logs & History
```bash
git log                          # View commit history
git log --oneline                # Condensed history

```

---

## üí° Tips
- Use **descriptive branch names** like `feature/login-form` or `bugfix/payment-issue`
- Always `git pull` before starting work
- Commit often with clear messages

- ### Working Tree

   ```
   Directory and files where you are currently working on.
   ```

- ### Repository (repo)
   ```
   Directory located on top level of working tree where Git keeps all the history.

   - Generally stored as project.git

   ```


- ### Object
   ```
   - blob --> ordinary file
   - tree --> represents directory
   - commit --> specific version of working tree
   - tag --> name of that commit
   ```

- ### Commit
   ```
   - Once commit is made, Changes are visible to others to see
   
   - A file as several states in git.
        - Untracked --> git doesn't know about this file. (first time file created)
        - Tracked --> Actively monitored
            - Unmodified
            - Modified
            - Staged
            - Commited
   ```

- ### Branch
   ```
   - Branches are best way to experiment with your code before merging to main branch
   - Collection of linked commits. 
   - Main --> Main is when a repository is initialized.
   - HEAD --> Current branch is called as head.
   
   - git checkout -b "new-branch-name"
   ```

- ### Pull requests

    Signalling your code is ready to be merged with main branch.


- ### Github Flow

    Github flow cycle.

      ‚úÖ  Create feature branch from main branch
      ‚úÖ  Write your code in child branch
      ‚úÖ  Commit your code.
      ‚úÖ  Create a pull request (PR)
      ‚úÖ  Let PR be reviewed and approved.
      ‚úÖ  Merge into main branch.
      ‚úÖ  You can delete the child branch (So that no one will use that branch)

- ### Github Issues
    GitHub Issues are used to track ideas, feedback, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub

- ### Discussions
    Not related to code and meant to have open conversations in public

- ### Github Code Scanning
      GitHub code scanning to identify, resolve, and prevent insecure coding patterns.

- ### CodeQL
      CodeQL is a static analysis testing tool that helps you identify security weaknesses such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and code injection issues

- ### Github Actions
      Github Actions is the automation and CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

    https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/understanding-github-actions

- ### Github Copilot
      Github Copilot helps you write code faster with less work.

- Remote
   ```
   another repo created remotely when a repo is created.
   - origin --> name created for remote repo
   ```

- Commands, Sub commands, options
   ```
   - Commands --> git
   - Sub-commands --> push, pull
   - options --> - or --, --hard
   ```

   - Go to the folder
   - git init // To initialize git folder
   - Or git init --initial-branch=main // new repo with initial branch name = main
   - Or git init -b main
   - echo "# gitlearning" >> README.md // Add readme.md
   - git add . // add git
   - git commit -m "Initial commit"
   - git remote add origin https://github.com/skthati/gitlearning.git // Push an 
   existing repository from command line.
   - git branch -M main //Rename old branch to new branch name.
   - git push -u origin main
   - git status // Shows the status of working branch
   - ls -a // To check if git files exists
   ```

- Create new branch
    ```
    git switch -c new-branch-name

    or 

    git checkout -b new-branch-name
    ```

- Push new branch to remote
    ```
    git push -u origin new-branch-name

    ```
- Git Rules
    ```
    ‚úÖ  Create or switch to new branch
